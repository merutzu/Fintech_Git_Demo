##  Mission
 
 
  At Coinbase, the mission is to create an open financial system for the world. Founders believe that open protocols for money will create more innovation, economic freedom, and equality of opportunity in the world, just like the internet did for publishing information. 
  Their trying to eliminate inefficiencies in the current financial system.  High Cost of wiring money to another country, unnecessary waiting time (banks are closed on the weekends and also taking 3 business days to transfer money.  High tax rates on every retail transaction in our economy (Credit Cards). They predicted that by 2020 85 percent of the world's population will have smartphones which will facilitate those developing countries to also have access to the same financial service.  Investing in protocols that will remove middle men from as many industries as possible.

 Approximately 56 million verified users, 7,000 institutions, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries trust Coinbase to easily and securely invest, spend, save, earn, and use crypto.

 Coinbase’s customers typically fall into one of two groups: (1) investors, and (2) those transacting with cryptoassets. For investors, Coinbase encourages transferring funds into its “cold storage” vaults, which it guarantees against Coinbase hacking. These vaults are disconnected from the internet and offer increased security. For those transacting (or trading on other exchanges), Coinbase allows users to send funds from Coinbase to other wallets.

Coinbase offers Equality of Opportunity / Intuitive and friendly user interface.  Digital Currency Wallet. Also provides Coinbase Pro which has advance charting functions and allows users to make crypto-to-crypto transactions, as well as place market, limit and stop orders. 
 
 Coinbase has soared in popularity and turned itself into the on-ramp for mainstream crypto investors by positioning itself as a safe harbor among cryptoasset exchanges. The company has never been hacked, unlike many of its competitors. Coinbase has also maniacally pursued compliance with existing regulations and law enforcement, putting it on the right side of the law — another huge asset in a sector that is still in desperate need of regulatory guidance.

 This has helped Coinbase secure $217M in equity financing from some of the biggest-name VCs, and vaulted the company into the unicorn club.

 ### Metrics

Verified Users of 56 million
Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) of 6.1 million
Assets on Platform of $223 billion, representing 11.3% crypto asset market share
Includes 122 billion dollars of Assets on Platform from Institutions
Trading Volume of 335 billion dollars
Total Revenue of approximately 1.8 billion dollars
Net Income of approximately 730 million to 800 million dollars
Adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.1 billion dollars.

Assets on Platform. CB defines Assets on Platform as the total U.S. dollar equivalent value of both fiat currency and crypto assets held or managed in digital wallets on our platform, including our custody services, calculated based on the market price on the date of measurement. Assets on Platform demonstrates the scale of balances held across our suite of products and services, the trust customers place in us to securely store their assets, and the underlying growth of the cryptoeconomy. Assets on Platform also represent our monetization opportunity for subscription products and services, including current products such as Store, Stake, Save, Borrow, and Lend. Assets on Platform generate fees that are recorded as subscription and services revenue when customers engage with these products.

Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs). CB defines an MTU as a retail user who actively or passively transacts in one or more products on our platform at least once during the rolling 28-day period ending on the date of measurement. MTUs presented for the end of a quarter are the average of each month’s MTUs in each respective quarter. MTUs represent our transacting base of retail users who drive potential revenue generating transactions on our platform. Revenue generating transactions include active transactions, such as buying or selling crypto assets through our Invest product and spending on the Coinbase Card, or passive transactions such as earning a staking or savings reward. MTUs also engage in transactions that are non-revenue generating such as Send and Receive. MTUs engage in transactions that drive both transaction revenue and subscription and services revenue.

Trading Volume. CB defines Trading Volume as the total U.S. dollar equivalent value of matched trades transacted between a buyer and seller through the platform during the period of measurement. Trading Volume represents the product of the quantity of asset transacted and the trade price at the time the transaction was executed. As trading activity directly impacts transaction revenue,this measure is a reflection of liquidity, trading health, and the underlying growth of the cryptoeconomy. Trading Volume is influenced by the price of Bitcoin and crypto asset volatility. In periods of high Bitcoin price and/or crypto asset volatility, Coinbase has experienced correspondingly high levels of Trading Volume on their platform.

Verified Users. CB defines Verified Users as all retail users, institutions, and ecosystem partners that have registered an account on their platform and confirmed either their email address or phone number, or that have established an account with a username on their non-custodial wallet application, as of the date of measurement. Verified Users are an indication of their scale and represent a potential revenue opportunity for Coinbase. These customers have demonstrated an interest in Coinbase platform or direct intent to transact with crypto assets. Verified Users represent the top level of Coinbase customer acquisition funnel. Coinbase believes they have an opportunity to engage Verified Users and convert them to MTUs by marketing their growing suite of products and services. Verified Users may overstate the number of unique customers who have registered an account on their platform as one customer may register for, and use, multiple accounts with different email addresses, phone numbers, or usernames.


 ## Competition 

    
Coinbase and GDAX face direct competition from a number of fiat-cryptoasset exchanges. Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Kraken, and recent entrant to the US market bitFlyer are Coinbase’s main competitors, although there are others, including traditional brokerages like Robinhood (which just announced support for cryptoasset trading in five states).

It’s important to note that Coinbase does not support crypto-crypto pairs (e.g. BTC/ETH) and only supports fiat-crypto pairs (e.g. BTC/USD). As a result, the company’s pool of competitors is more limited, as there are hundreds of crypto-crypto exchanges

 
## Recommendations
 
To make it a "crypto-first” exchange and offer many types of trading, including margin trading, futures trading, as well as lowering High fees on on buying and selling.
By implemeting these other trading financial options, their user-base numbers would immensely go up and also would eliminatie any strong competitors in the market. 
Lowering fees would greatly go a long adding these other trading features. 
It would facilitate traders trading execution time, and ultimately growing Coinbase active monthly users. 

## Closing thoughts

To hedge its exchange, Coinbase plans on adding more assets to its platform according to its “Digital Asset Framework.” Doing so would certainly pad the company’s pockets, but it would also allow a large user base to explore new use cases for blockchain technology. Additional assets, then, are both a hedge and a gamble on the sector’s future.
